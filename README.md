## Methodology
1. **Pre-trained Models:**
   - Evaluated MobileNet, MobileNetV3, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201.
   - DenseNet201 outperformed others with 83% accuracy.
2. **Architecture:**
   - Base: DenseNet201 with custom layers.
   - Features:
     - Global Average Pooling.
     - Dense Layer with ReLU activation.
     - Dropout for regularization.
     - Final softmax output layer.
3. **Training Strategy:**
   - Transfer learning: Fine-tuned DenseNet201 with last dense block unfreezed.
   - Loss reduction via `ReduceLROnPlateau` and `EarlyStopping` callbacks.
